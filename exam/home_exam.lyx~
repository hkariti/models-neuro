General understanding
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The contraction bias is the phenomenon where participants, when presented
 with two tones (or any other signal) at different times, tend to report
 the first tone as higher if both tones are of low pitch and the second
 tone as higher if both tones are of high pitch.
 This can be seen in the participant's performance as shown in Figure 2
 of the paper: the yellow area shows better performance since the contraction
 magnifies the existing difference and helps participants make the correct
 choice.
 On the other hand, in the grey area the contraction shrinks this difference,
 making the decision harder for participants.
 The grey area therefore shows worse performance, even for the same absolute
 difference in pitch compared to the yellow area.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
In the Bayesian model, the listener takes into account both the heard tone
 and their internal expectation of that tone's pitch.
 Since their internal representation of the tone is noisy, adding their
 prior knowledge of the pitch's distribution will improve their performance
 (and assuming their prior knowledge is correct, this is the MAP estimator
 and so optimal).
 However, this can cause contraction: if the prior distribution is unimodal,
 all estimations will drift towards a single value, determined by the distributi
on's median.
 Moreover, the first tone suffers more contraction: since it's kept in memory
 longer its representation is noisier, and so the prior knowledge's effect
 is stronger on the final estimation making the drift larger.
 This makes the first tone be perceived as of higher pitch when both tones
 are low (drift up) and of lower pitch when both tones are high (drift down),
 explaining the contraction bias.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The recency effect is the fact that recent trials (and stimuli in general)
 have a stronger effect on the participant current choice that trials that
 are further in the past.
 The Bayesian model does not capture it since there is no mention of past
 trials except the prior distribution, which is stationary and so shouldn't
 change from trial to trial.
 The implicit-memory model does capture it, since its memory part is an
 exponentially-weighted average of past stimuli.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The JND is a measure of the internal noise of the signal's representation.
 It captures the fact that participants have a certain degree of precision
 below which they cannot differentiate between the two pitches (red area
 close to diagonal in Figure 2 in the paper).
 It does not capture the contraction bias.
 The JND predicts a symmetry of successes/failures around zero pitch difference,
 but this is inconsistent with the contraction bias and actual observed
 data (grey/yellow areas in Figure 2).
 The paper isn't clear about how to compute the JND.
 It mentions that it's computed using a 'threshold of discrimination', however
 it does not mention what this threshold is.
 The Materials and Methods section says that the calculation is done by
 averaging the difference in frequencies in the 'last 6 reversals', but
 it's not clear what these reversals are.

\begin_layout Section
On the implicit-memory model and the linear-nonlinear model
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The implicit-memory model is used to model the decision process inside a
 participant's mind for a series of trials.
 For each trial, it compares the second observed pitch 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{2}$
\end_inset

 with the exponentially-weighted average of the first pitch's noisy history,
 marked 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

.
 The model reports that the first tone is higher if 
\begin_inset Formula $M>f_{2}$
\end_inset

 and otherwise that the second tone is higher.
 The linear-nonlinear model is used to test whether a a given sequence of
 trials and choices is affected by the recency effect.
 The model calculates the probability of choosing 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{1}>f_{2}$
\end_inset

 based on the recent history of pitches.
 If the fitted weights are smaller for trials further in the past, it means
 they have smaller effect on the result than more recent trials, i.e.
 the decision is affected by the recency effect.
 The two models are related by the recency effect: the linear-nonlinear
 model detects this effect, and the implicit-memory model can explain it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The filter here consists of adding noise and memory of past values.
 We'll show that neither have a significant effect on the result if added
 to 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{2}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Let 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{2}(t)$
\end_inset

 be the Gaussian noise with variance 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{2}^{2}$
\end_inset

 that is associated with encoding 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 Also assume that 
\begin_inset Formula $n(t),n_{2}(t)$
\end_inset

 are independent.
 If he model now compares using 
\begin_inset Formula $M(t)>log(f_{2}(t))+n_{2}(t)$
\end_inset

, we get:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
(1-\eta)(\log(f_{1}(t))+n_{1}(t))+\eta M(t) & >\log(f_{2}(t))+n_{2}(t)\\
(1-\eta)(\log(f_{1}(t))+n_{1}(t)-\frac{1}{1-\eta}n_{2}(t))+\eta M(t) & >\log(f_{2}(t))\\
(1-\eta)(\log(f_{1}(t))+\tilde{n}(t))+\eta M(t) & >\log(f_{2}(t))
\end{align*}

\end_inset


\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Where 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{n}(t)$
\end_inset

 is a Gaussian noise with variance 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\sigma}^{2}=\sigma^{2}+\frac{1}{(1-\eta)^{2}}\sigma_{2}^{2}$
\end_inset

.
 We got that adding noise to 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{2}$
\end_inset

 is equivalent to adding more noise to 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{1}$
\end_inset

 instead.
 Since we don't assume anything about the amount of noise in 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{1}$
\end_inset

, adding noise to 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{2}$
\end_inset

 is redundant.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Looking at Figure 3 in the paper, we can see that the weights for past values
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{2}$
\end_inset

 are much smaller than the weight for the current value.
 This means that past values of 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{2}$
\end_inset

 don't affect the participants' decision, and adding memory to 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{2}$
\end_inset

 will make little difference.

\begin_layout Subsection
Running with noise and no memory
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Setting 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta=0$
\end_inset

 means past trials have no effect, and each trial is independent and is
 a simple comparison between a noisy 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 Therefore we expect to see no contraction bias, and the graph should be
 symmetric relative to the diagonal.
 Because the comparison is noisy we expect mistakes to occur, but they should
 be mostly close to the diagonal since the noise variance is small relative
 to the frequency range.
 We observe all of these in Figure

The psychometric plot in Figure

 shows that performance depends only on the difference between the frequencies,
 and is the same when either 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{1}$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{2}$
\end_inset

 is larger.
 This corresponds to what we saw in the scatter plot: performance improves
 as we get further from the diagonal and is symmetric relative to the diagonal.
 Since the scatter plot shows no contraction bias, only the distance from
 the diagonal affects performance and so this psychometric plot summarizes
 the scatter plot.

 shows the fitting result of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Phi$
\end_inset

\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 The fit results in 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{f}=0.298\approx0.3=\sigma$
\end_inset

.
 This result makes sense.
 First, we see that the frequency difference and noise are in the correct
 relation: as noise gets stronger the performance drops, and as it weakens
 the performance improves.
 Second, it matches our previous observations.
 In the scatter plot in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Performance-of-implicit-memory"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 we saw that two parameters affect performance: the difference between the
 frequencies (performance gets better the further we are from the diagonal),
 and the internal noise (the rate of improvement).
 Since the fitted function describes the psychometric plot, and since that
 plot summarizes the scatter plot, it makes sense that the second parameter
 in the fitted function is the noise.

Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 shows the results when setting 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

 to 0.4 and removing noise.
 Looking at the scatter plot, the first thing we notice is that it's no
 longer symmetric.
 Specifically, the areas 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{1}>f_{2}>1000$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{1}<f_{2}<1000$
\end_inset

 show a significant increase in errors.
 This points to a contraction bias, which is caused by the non-zero value
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

.
 As said in in the previous section, this non-zero value makes the model
 average previously seen values of 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{1}$
\end_inset

 (with an exponentially decreasing weight) when calculating 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

.
 Since the weight decreases exponentially, only the very recent values of
 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{1}$
\end_inset

 have a significant effect.
 For large values of 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{1}$
\end_inset

 there's a high probability that these previous values were lower, causing
 
\begin_inset Formula $M<f_{1}$
\end_inset

.
 For small values of 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{1}$
\end_inset

 the reverse happens and 
\begin_inset Formula $M>f_{1}$
\end_inset

.
 This is exactly the contraction that causes the bias.
 Another thing we can notice in the plot is the very low level of errors
 outside of the contraction bias.
 For comparison, Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Performance-of-implicit-memory"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 had errors even far from the diagonal, whereas here we have in some places
 zero errors right at the diagonal.
 This is the result of 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma=0$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Looking at the psychometric plot, we see that it no longer summarizes the
 scatter plot.
 For example, it predicts a 50% of errors at the diagonal coming from either
 direction, but we see that this isn't the case: In the upper right area,
 one side of the diagonal has 100% errors and the other has 0% errors; in
 the lower left area this situation is completely reversed.
 Moreover, I believe the psychometric plot can't be expected to summarize
 the scatter plot.
 Since the scatter plot changes at different places along the diagonal and
 also at different distances from the diagonal, one cannot summarize it
 using a plot that depends on a single parameter (the distance from the
 diagonal in this case).

a: the noise adds errors in all areas of the graph symmetrically according

 When looking at the quantitative data the contraction bias is clear: areas
 1 and 4 show much worse performance.
 Areas 3 and 6 show improved performance, which is probably because they
 stretch furthest from the diagonal.

 performance due to contraction bias (areas 1 and 4).
 This was done to test whether the contraction bias always exists (i.e.
 participants always used prior knowledge) or only when it improved overall
 performance.
 The Bayesian model predicts that the contraction bias will appear in both
 cases, because if the participants know the joint prior distribution then
 using it should always improve performance.
 The implicit-memory model predict that using prior knowledge will be beneficial
 in the Bias+ condition but harmful in the Bias- condition, and so the contracti
on bias should not appear in the latter.

 shows the result of the implicit-memory model run on the given data.
 We can see that for the Bias+ condition, the model agrees with the data
 near the diagonal, especially in the Bias- regions.
 The two graph disagree further from the diagonal, and this is very apparent
 in the Bias+ and neutral regions.
 For the Bias- condition, we can see that the model shows more mistakes
 near the diagonal than the real data.
 Here too there is better agreement in the Bias+ regions and more disagreement
 in the Bias- regions.

Both graph show the effect of

 The

 variable, being the average of the recent 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{1}$
\end_inset

 values, will be closer to 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{1}$
\end_inset

's recent values.
 However, whether or not this will result in a mistake is affected by 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{1}$
\end_inset

's distribution, which is different between the two conditions as shown
 in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

.
 The Bias+ distribution is unimodal and so most of the time 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{1}$
\end_inset

's values are not very high or very low, and underestimation of higher values
 and overestimation of lower values result in mistakes.
 However, the Bias- is bimodal, and so 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{1}$
\end_inset

 can take higher and lower values, which makes the decision less sensitive
 to contractions.
 This can be seen by the mean absolute difference between 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{2}$
\end_inset

: in the Bias+ condition, this mean difference is 
\begin_inset Formula $\sim45Hz$
\end_inset

, whereas in the Bias- condition this difference is 
\begin_inset Formula $\sim116Hz$
\end_inset

.
 This shows that the Bias- condition results in frequency pairs that are
 less sensitive to contraction.
